        <li><strong>Black Holes:</strong> Mysterious cosmic objects with gravitational forces so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.</li>
        <li><strong>Relativity:</strong> The theory that describes how the fabric of spacetime is influenced by mass and energy, as formulated by Albert Einstein.</li>
